# How to Setup on Local Machine

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and npm. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that is required to run ReactJS apps. npm is a package manager for Node.js that is used to install and manage dependencies.
2. Clone the ReactJS app from GitHub. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the app. Then, run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/DipanshuTyagi/Pawyer-Portfolio.git
```

This will clone the ReactJS app from GitHub to your local machine.

3. Install the app's dependencies. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the app and run the following command: 
```
npm install

```
This will install all of the app's dependencies.

4. Start the app's development server. Run the following command:
```
npm start

```
This will start the app's development server on port 3000.

5. Open the app in your web browser. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the ReactJS app running in your browser.

Here are some additional tips:

- If you are using a different package manager, such as Yarn, you can use the following command to install the app's dependencies:
```
yarn install

```
- If you want to start the app's development server on a different port, you can use the following command:
```
npm start <port>
```
- If you are using a Mac, you can also start the app's development server using the following command:
  ```
    open http://localhost:3000 
  ```
This will open the app in your default web browser.

Once you have set up the ReactJS app in your local machine, you can start developing and testing it. You can also use the app to learn more about ReactJS and how it works.
